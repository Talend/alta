 Using Pax Exam in Maven builds

Using Pax Exam in Maven builds

* Problems with the traditional approach

  The {{{http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxexam/Pax+Exam+-+Tutorial+1}recommended approach}}
  (see also {{{http://docs.peergreen.com/peergreen_server/latest/reference/xhtml-single/peergreen-server-osgi-paxexam-junit-guide.xhtml}here}})
  to run OSGi unit tests with Pax Exam in a Maven build relies on the <<<pax-url-aether>>> library.
  This library allows to resolve Maven artifacts and to provision them as bundles to the OSGi
  runtime started by Pax Exam. Assuming that the bundles to be provisioned are declared as
  Maven dependencies in the project, a typical Pax Exam configuration would look as follows
  (Note that <<<asInProject()>>> relies on the execution of the
  <<<org.apache.servicemix.tooling:depends-maven-plugin>>> during the build):
  
----------------------------------------
@Configuration
public static Option[] configuration() {
    return options(
        mavenBundle().groupId("org.apache.felix")
                     .artifactId("org.apache.felix.configadmin")
                     .version(asInProject()),
        junitBundles());
}
----------------------------------------

  While at first glance this looks straightforward and natural, there are a couple of issues with this approach.
  The problem is that <<<pax-url-aether>>> creates its own Maven session to resolve artifacts, thereby bypassing
  the underlying Maven build. This means that the resolution performed by Pax Exam doesn't necessarily use the
  same configuration as the Maven build. There are several known circumstances where this causes problems:
  
  [[1]] Repositories configured in the POM. Some have {{{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ops4j/kRxAXidbt7A/w0i6tM1Mn9MJ}argued}}
  that declaring repositories in POMs is discouraged. That argument is correct for repositories containing release artifacts,
  but not for snapshot repositories: all release dependencies should indeed be available from the central repository, but
  dependencies on snapshot versions from upstream projects necessarily require configuration of additional repositories.
  The right place to configure these repositories is in the POM, not in <<<settings.xml>>>.
  
  [[2]] The location of the local Maven repository (normally specified in <<<settings.xml>>>) can be overridden using
  the <<<maven.repo.local>>> system property. However, Pax Exam only looks at <<<settings.xml>>>.
  While overriding the local Maven repository on the command line is rarely done when running Maven manually,
  it is quite common for builds executed by a CI tool. E.g. Jenkins has a "Use private Maven repository" option that does
  exactly that (with a local repository in the Jenkins workspace). This problem is described in
  {{{https://ops4j1.jira.com/browse/PAXEXAM-543}PAXEXAM-543}}.
  
  [[3]] Offline mode. This mode is enabled using the <<<-o>>> switch on the <<<mvn>>> command, but Pax Exam has no
  way to detect this and will continue trying to access remote Maven repositories.
  
  []
  
  Probably this list is not exhaustive and there are other POM settings that will cause similar problems.
  
  Actually the whole approach of having Pax Exam resolve Maven dependencies on its own is questionable.
  This is certainly a very useful feature when used outside of a Maven build (e.g. to provision bundles directly
  from a Maven repository to a stand-alone OSGi container), but in a Maven build, it should be Maven's responsibility
  to download artifacts, and Pax Exam's role should be limited to provisioning them to the embedded OSGi container.

* (Partial) solution

  The {{{https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/paxurl/Link+Protocol}<<<link:>>> protocol}} (together with the
  {{{https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/paxurl/Classpath+Protocol}<<<classpath:>>> protocol}}) supported by Pax URL
  comes to our rescue to solve this problem. The idea is to let Maven resolve the artifacts and to generate link
  files that contain <<<file:>>> URLs to the bundles in the local Maven repository. They can then be deployed
  using <<<url>>> options:

%{snippet|id=configuration|file=src/it/pax-exam/src/test/java/OsgiTest.java}

  These files can easily be generated using {{{../generate-test-resources-mojo.html}alta:generate-test-resources}}.
  The template for the resource name (<<<name>>> parameter) would be <<<%bundle.symbolicName%.link>>> and the template for
  the content (<<<value>>> parameter) would be <<<%url%>>>.

* More problems

  This only solves the problem partially because it doesn't eliminate the usage of the <<<mvn:>>>
  protocol entirely.
  
  The reason is that even with the project setup described above, <<<pax-exam-link-mvn>>> is still
  a required dependency. That JAR contains a set of link files that refer to Maven artifacts using
  the <<<mvn:>>> protocol. E.g. the <<<META-INF/links/org.ops4j.pax.exam.link>>> resource contains:

----------------------------------------
mvn:org.ops4j.pax.exam/pax-exam/3.3.0
----------------------------------------

  The link files are referenced using hardcoded URLs in [TODO: where?].
  Unfortunately, these link files can't be generated directly by
  {{{../generate-test-resources-mojo.html}alta:generate-test-resources}}.
  The reason is that they don't follow a consistent naming convention: some of them
  use the symbolic name, but not all of them.
